Overall Assessment: 1/5

Additional Comments: 

- If the relationship is now a many to many that would mean a book no longer belongs to an author. 

- You removed the `book.authors` method

- Your `author.books` method is not written correctly.

- Your `author.write_book` method is also not written correctly


After the review lecture, go back through this assignment and try to correct as many mistakes as you can. 



Update: 3/5

Comments: Overall much better job. Make sure you understand why the solution works.
